# Firmware backups [UNTESTED]

I have not tried to restore said backups as I don't intend to go back to the Sailfish firmware.

## Atmega8U2

Contains the firmware that acts like a USB to UART bridge and it also does update of Sailfish firmware in a similar way as ordinary Arduino.

## Atmega2560

Contains the image of main Sailfish firmware. All magic lives here and makes your printer do things... unimaginable things.
